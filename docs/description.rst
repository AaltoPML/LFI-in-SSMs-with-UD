ELFI is a statistical software package for likelihood-free inference (LFI) such as
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC_). The term LFI refers to a family of inference
methods that replace the use of the likelihood function with a data generating simulator
function. Other names or related approaches to LFI include simulator-based inference,
approximate Bayesian inference, indirect inference, etc.

ELFI features an easy to use syntax and supports parallelized inference out of the box.
